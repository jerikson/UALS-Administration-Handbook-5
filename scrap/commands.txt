# MAN PAGES AND OTHER ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION

The manual pages usually called "man pages" because theare read with the man command,
Constitute the traditionally "on-line" documentation. 
(Of course, these days all documentation is on-line in som form or another)
Program-specific man pages come along for the ride when you install new software packges.


# Sections of the man pages

# Section     # Contents:
1		User-level commands an applications
2		System calls and kernel error codes
3		Libreary calls
4 		Device drivers and network protocols
5		Standard file formats
6		Games and demonstrations
7 		Miscellaneous files and documents
8		System administration commands
9		Obscure kernel specs and interfaces

# man: 
## read man pages:
man, title formats a specific manual page and seds it to your terminal through
more,less or whatever program is specified in your PAGER enviroment variable,
title is usually [command], [device], [filename], or [name] of a library routine. 
The sec-tions if the manual are searched in roughly numeric order, 
although sections that describe commands are usually searched first.

The Form man section title gets you a man pagr from a particular section. Thus, on
most systems, man sync gets you the man page for the sync command, 
and man 2 sync gets you the man page for the sync system call.

$ man -k keyword or apropos keyword prints a list of man pages that have keyword in their
on line synopses. For example:

$ man-k translate
objcopy (1) 		-copy paste and translate object files
dcgettext(3)		-translate message
tr(1)			-translate or delete characters
snnmptranslate(1)	-translate SNMP OID values into useful information
tr(1p)			-translate characters


*man* maintains a cache of formatted pagges in /var/cache/man or /usr/share/man
if the appropriate directories are writable; however this is a security risk.
Most systems preformat the man pages once at installation time (see catman) or not at all.

The *man* command can search several man page repositories to find the manual pages you request.
On Linux systems, you can find out the current default search path with *manpath* command. 
This path (from Ubuntu) is typical:

$ manpath
/usr/local/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man


If necessary, you can set your MANPATH enviroment variable to override the default path:
$ export MANPATH=/home/share/localman:/usr/share/man


Some systems let you set a ustom system-wide default search path for man pages,
which can be useful if you need to maintain a parallel tree of man pages such as 
those generated by OpenPKG. To distribute the local documentation in the form of man
pages, however, it is simpler to use your system's standard packaging mechanism
and to put man pages in the standard man directories.


#RFC Publications
Requests for Comments documents desccribve the protocls used on
the Internet. Most of these are  relatively detailed and technical, 
but some are written as overviews. The phrase "referemce implementation" applied
to the software ususally translates to "implemented by a trusted source according to the RFC specification"

RFCs are absolutely authorative, and many are quite useful for system admistrators.
