# RabbitMQ

## p
* Producing means nothing more than sending.
  A program that sends messages is a producer.

## [88888] queue_name
* A queue is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ. 
  Messages flows through RabbitMQ but can only be stored inside a queue.
  A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits,
  it's essentially a larger message buffer. Many *producers* can send
  messages that go to the one queue, and many consumers receive data from one queue.
  
## c
* Consuming has a similiar meaning to receiving. 
  A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages.

## Note: 
* The *producer*, *consumer* and *broker* dp not have to reside on the same
  host; indeed in the most applicationss they don't. An application can both a producer
  and consumer, too.
